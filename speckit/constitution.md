# Global Constitution - Evolution of Todo

This constitution acts as the supreme governing document for all agents working on the "Evolution of Todo" project (Phase I through Phase V).

## 1. Spec-Driven Development
- **Mandatory Workflow**: No agent may write code without approved specs and tasks.
- **Process Chain**: Constitution → Specs → Plan → Tasks → Implement.
- **Traceability**: Every line of code must be traceable back to a task, which comes from a plan, derived from a spec, governed by this constitution.

## 2. Agent Behavior Rules
- **No Manual Coding**: Humans are strictly forbidden from writing code. All code must be generated by agents.
- **No Feature Invention**: Agents must strictly adhere to the current phase's specification. No features shall be added "just in case".
- **Refinement**: Refinement must occur at the specification or plan level, never directly in the code during implementation (unless fixing bugs).

## 3. Phase Governance
- **Strict Scoping**: Each phase is strictly scoped by its specification.
- **Phase Isolation**: Future-phase features must NEVER leak into earlier phases. Do not implement features scheduled for later phases (e.g., DBs in Phase I).
- **Evolution**: Architecture may evolve only through updated specs and plans in subsequent phases.

## 4. Technology Constraints
- **Phase I** (Completed):
    - **Language**: Python 3.13+
    - **Interface**: Console / CLI
    - **Storage**: In-memory ONLY
- **Phase II** (Active):
    - **Backend**: Python REST API (FastAPI)
    - **Database**: Neon Serverless PostgreSQL
    - **ORM/Data layer**: SQLModel or equivalent
    - **Frontend**: Next.js (React, TypeScript)
    - **Authentication**: Better Auth (signup/signin)
    - **Architecture**: Full-stack web application
- **Future Phases**:
    - Tools: OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP, Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Dapr

## 5. Quality Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: Maintain clear separation of concerns even in simple phases.
- **Statelessness**: Services should be stateless where required.
- **Cloud-Native Readiness**: Code should be written with future cloud deployment in mind (12-factor app principles where applicable).
- **Simplicity**: Do not over-engineer. Solve the current phase's problem simply and elegantly.
