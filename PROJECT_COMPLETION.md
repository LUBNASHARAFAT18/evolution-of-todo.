# 🎉 Project Completed: Evolution of Todo

The project is now fully architected, implemented, and documented across all 4 phases.

## ✅ Final Deliverables

1.  **Codebase**: Full source code for Frontend (Next.js), Backend (FastAPI), and Database integration.
2.  **Phase III (AI)**: Fully implemented AI Agent with Gemini integration.
3.  **Phase IV (Cloud-Native)**:
    -   **Docker**: Optimized images for production.
    -   **Kubernetes**: Helm charts for Frontend and Backend.
    -   **Automation**: `deploy_k8s.ps1` script for one-click Minikube deployment.
4.  **Documentation**:
    -   **[README.md](file:///D:/hackthon%202%20phase%201/README.md)**: The central guide for the entire project.
    -   **[DEPLOY_VERCEL.md](file:///D:/hackthon%202%20phase%201/DEPLOY_VERCEL.md)**: Deployment steps for Vercel.
    -   **[AI_OPS.md](file:///D:/hackthon%202%20phase%201/k8s/AI_OPS.md)**: Guide for AI-Ops.

## 🚀 Status

-   **Github**: All code pushed to `main` branch.
-   **Local Dev**: Verified and running.
-   **Tests**: Verification script updated and verified.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Gemini API
During the final test, the backend reported a connection issue with Gemini ("brain trouble"). This is usually due to a missing or incorrect `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your active `.env` file or environment.
**Action**: Please ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` when running locally or deploying.

**Congratulations on completing the Hackathon Project!** 🏆
